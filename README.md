✨ Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Overview

Welcome to the Learning DSA repository! This resource is dedicated to mastering the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into computer science, a student preparing for exams, or a professional getting ready for technical interviews, this repository aims to be your comprehensive and structured learning companion.

This repository contains organized solutions, explanations, and practice problems implemented primarily in Python and JavaScript.

Why DSA?

Mastering DSA is essential for:

Optimal Problem Solving: Learning how to select the right tool (data structure) for the job and applying efficient methods (algorithms) to solve complex problems.

Technical Interviews: DSA forms the backbone of almost all technical interviews for software engineering roles.

Writing Efficient Code: Understanding the time and space complexity of your code.

📚 Repository Structure & Contents

The content is organized into modules, covering fundamental concepts first and gradually moving towards more advanced topics.
